## Example  

Prompt - A human would generally use prior knowledge and connections to make decisions.
Similarly, when solving the Raven’s test, a human would gain knowledge
and once it has registered that knowledge, it would use it to make decisions or
expect an output. In reference to the Raven’s problems, as a human, I would
first examine the A = B figures of the problems. Without realizing it, and not
in sequential order, a human would make connections on how A is equal to B.
It would informally construct a semantics network between figure A and B.

Proofread my writing above. Fix grammar and spelling mistakes. And make suggestions that will improve the clarity of my writing

Answer - A human would typically rely on prior knowledge and connections when making decisions. Similarly, when solving the Raven's test, a human would acquire knowledge and then use it to make decisions or anticipate an outcome. Regarding the Raven's problems, as a human, I would first examine the A = B figures in the problems. Subconsciously, and not necessarily in a specific order, a human would establish connections between how A is equal to B. This would informally construct a semantic network between figure A and B.
