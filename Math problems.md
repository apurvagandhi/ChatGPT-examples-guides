## Promt:
integrate x^2

## Response:
To integrate x^2, we can use the power rule of integration, which states that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration. Applying this rule to x^2, we get:

âˆ« x^2 dx = (x^3)/3 + C

Therefore, the antiderivative of x^2 is (x^3)/3 + C, where C is an arbitrary constant.

## Promt:
differentiate x^2

## Response:
To differentiate x^2, we can use the power rule of differentiation, which states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1). Applying this rule to x^2, we get:

d/dx (x^2) = 2x

Therefore, the derivative of x^2 is 2x.
