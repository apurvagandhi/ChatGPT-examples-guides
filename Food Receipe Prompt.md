## Response:
Sure, here is a recipe for making aloo paratha, a popular Indian flatbread stuffed with spiced mashed potatoes:

Ingredients:

2 cups of whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon oil or ghee
Water, as needed
2 large potatoes, boiled and mashed
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1/2 teaspoon red chili powder
Salt, to taste
1/2 teaspoon amchur (dried mango powder)
Oil or ghee, for cooking
Instructions:

In a large mixing bowl, add the whole wheat flour, salt, and oil or ghee. Mix well. Gradually add water, kneading until the dough comes together and is smooth and elastic. Cover the dough and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.

In a separate bowl, mix the mashed potatoes, cumin seeds, coriander powder, red chili powder, salt, and amchur. Mix well.

Divide the dough into equal-sized balls. Take one ball and roll it out into a small circle. Place a spoonful of the potato mixture in the center of the circle. Gather the edges of the circle and seal the filling inside. Gently press down on the stuffed dough ball and roll it out into a flat circle, about 6 inches in diameter.

Heat a griddle or non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, place the rolled-out paratha on the griddle. Cook for about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until the paratha is golden brown and crispy, brushing with oil or ghee as needed.

Repeat with the remaining dough balls and potato mixture.

Serve hot with your favorite chutney, yogurt, or pickle. Enjoy your homemade aloo paratha!
