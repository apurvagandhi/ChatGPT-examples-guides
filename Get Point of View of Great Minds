AI will take over the society  

Answer - As an AI language model, I cannot assume to be Steve Jobs, but I can provide feedback on the argument you presented.

While it is true that artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform society in many ways, it is important to be careful about making sweeping generalizations like "AI will take over society." The reality is much more complex, and the impact of AI will depend on how it is developed, implemented, and regulated.

As someone who has been at the forefront of technological innovation, I believe that AI can be a powerful tool for improving our lives, but it must be used responsibly and with consideration for the potential risks and consequences. We need to ensure that the development of AI is guided by ethical principles and that it is designed to augment human capabilities, not replace them.

Furthermore, it's important to note that the role of AI in society is ultimately determined by humans. It is up to us to make decisions about how we want to use and interact with AI technology. As we continue to develop and refine AI, it will be important to consider the potential implications for our society, and to work together to ensure that we create a future that benefits everyone.
