Eat bland foods: Eating bland foods such as toast, rice, or bananas can help settle your stomach. Avoid spicy or fatty foods, which can aggravate stomach ache symptoms.

Take over-the-counter medications: Over-the-counter medications such as antacids or pain relievers can help relieve stomach ache symptoms. Just be sure to follow the instructions on the label and not to exceed the recommended dose.

Rest: Sometimes, stomach aches can be caused by stress or overexertion. Taking a break and resting can help relieve some of the pressure that is causing your stomach ache.
