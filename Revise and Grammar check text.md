Over the past one month, I have come across hundreds of post about ChatGPT and other AI tools. Many people have explored these powerful AI tools such as ChatGPT and Bard. I have been using chatGPT since past few months and Bard since past few weeks. One thing I have learned while using it is that it all comes down to how a user asks questions. The response is all dependent on that. Many people are not aware of how they can utilize these wonderful and insanely powerful tools. It's capability is hidden from many usrs as they are not aware of its usages. While people have posted cheat sheets and created top 10 ways to use them, it has become overwhelming to keep track of these posts or websites. Therefore, I had an idea today to create a Github repository where anyone can contribute and add tips based on their experience with ChatGPT or Bard. It is still at very initial stage but as I get more time and more data, we can organize so that anyone can search through them and use it as tutorial. The goal would  be to create something where a newly introduced person can quickly use it as cheatsheet or expericned person can use to make their search more effcitive. Once enough data is collected and we have more promots, we will organ8ize it in more logical manner. We can possibly create a website from these responses so taht users who might not be familiar with Github can easily contribute as well. I highly request anyone who is using this tools to contribute to this and make a library of questions and hints that other human users can use to get better results. 

### Response   
In the past month, I have encountered numerous posts about AI tools such as ChatGPT and Bard. Many individuals have explored the capabilities of these powerful AI tools, including myself, who has been utilizing ChatGPT for several months and Bard for a few weeks. One crucial lesson I have learned while using these tools is that the quality of the responses is highly dependent on the way a user phrases their questions. Unfortunately, many users are not fully aware of the potential of these tools due to their lack of knowledge regarding their applications. Despite the abundance of cheat sheets and top 10 lists available, it has become difficult to keep track of these resources. Consequently, I have formulated an idea to establish a Github repository where anyone can contribute tips based on their experiences with ChatGPT or Bard. Although this is in its initial stages, as more data is collected, it can be organized in a way that facilitates search and use as a tutorial. The objective is to create a library that can serve as a quick reference for novices or a valuable tool for experienced users to enhance their searches. Once sufficient data has been accumulated, a logical arrangement can be established, and a website can be constructed for those unfamiliar with Github to contribute. I earnestly urge users of these tools to contribute their insights to this initiative to foster the creation of a comprehensive repository of questions and tips that human users can use to improve their results.
